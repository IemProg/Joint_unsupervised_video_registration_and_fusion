# Unified Segmentation

We recently published a method on deep learning methods for unsupervised segmentation that makes use of voxelmorph infrastructure. We provide the atlases used during training. 

# Instructions

## Setup
It might be useful to have each folder inside the `ext` folder on your python path. 
assuming voxelmorph is setup at `/path/to/voxelmorph/`:

```
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/voxelmorph/ext/neuron/:/path/to/voxelmorph/ext/pynd-lib/:/path/to/voxelmorph/ext/pytools-lib/
```

If you would like to train/test your own model, you will likely need to write some of the data loading code in 'datagenerator.py' for your own datasets and data formats. There are several hard-coded elements related to data preprocessing and format. 


## Usage:

```
python train_unsupervised_segmentation.py /path/to/your/volume/data/
python test_unsupervised_segmentation.py input_file.nii output_seg_filename.nii
```
